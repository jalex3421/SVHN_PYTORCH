# SVHN_PYTORCH

The goal of this project is to solve a classification problem from start to finish using PyTorch. To achieve this, I will demonstrate a basic workflow that can be easily adapted for other projects.

The steps we will follow are:

- Import a dataset to work with.
- Load the data properly.
- Create or import AI models.
- Build functions to train the model.
- Compare the obtained results.
- Save the trained models.
- Import a custom image and generate a prediction.
